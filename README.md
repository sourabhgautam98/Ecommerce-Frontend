Welcome to the Ecommerce Frontend Project, a React-based application designed to provide a seamless shopping experience for users. This project is built using the latest technologies and best practices, ensuring a fast, secure, and user-friendly interface. The goal of this project is to demonstrate a scalable and maintainable architecture for a modern web application.

The project is divided into several components, each responsible for a specific functionality. The core components include authentication, routing, and data fetching. The application also utilizes various libraries and tools to ensure a smooth user experience, such as Axios for making API requests, Cookies for storing user data, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

‚ú® **Features**
-------------

1. **Authentication**: The application provides a secure authentication system, allowing users to log in and out using their credentials.
2. **Routing**: The application uses React Router to manage client-side routing, providing a seamless user experience.
3. **Data Fetching**: The application uses Axios to make API requests to the backend server, fetching data in a efficient and scalable manner.
4. **Cookies**: The application uses Cookies to store user data, ensuring a secure and persistent storage solution.
5. **Tailwind CSS**: The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling, providing a consistent and reusable design system.
6. **React Hooks**: The application uses React Hooks to manage state and side effects, providing a simple and efficient way to handle complex logic.
7. **ESLint Integration**: The application uses ESLint to ensure code quality and consistency, providing a set of rules and configurations to enforce best practices.
8. **Vite Integration**: The application uses Vite to provide a fast and efficient development environment, allowing for rapid prototyping and development.
9. **Module Development**: The application uses ES modules to develop and import modules, providing a modular and reusable architecture.
10. **Type Safety**: The application uses TypeScript to ensure type safety, providing a robust and maintainable codebase.
